    <h1>Observations and reflection on sleep</h1>

    <p>I've been using Whoop to track my sleep, and it's taught me a lot. On average, I need about 7.5 hours of sleep, but to get that, I actually need to be in bed for 8.5 hours because my sleep efficiency is only 85-90%. The quality of my sleep, exercise, and sickness also play a role in how rested I feel, even if I hit my 7.5-hour goal.</p>

    <p>Factors that affect my sleep quality:</p>

    <p>Time in bed: I used to think 7 hours in bed was enough, but that only gives me about 6.5 hours of actual sleep. I've realized I need more time in bed to get the sleep I need, especially when I'm active and working out daily.</p>

    <p>Consistency: Going to bed at the same time each night helps me fall asleep faster by creating a routine. I try to go to bed a bit after 9pm, and read on my Kindle until I fall asleep around 9:30pm.</p>

    <p>Food and drinks: Overeating at dinner, eating right before bed, skipping proper meals, snacking excessively, and drinking kombucha (which has caffeine) in the evening can all negatively impact my sleep quality.</p>

    <p>Caffeine timing: The amount and timing of my caffeine intake impact my sleep. I try to cut off caffeine between 1:00-1:30 pm.</p>

    <p>Screen time after 8pm: Using my phone, computer, or watching movies before bed makes it harder to fall asleep and sleep well. Avoiding screens close to bedtime is crucial.</p>

    <p>Room temperature and bedding: The temperature in my bedroom, my bedding, and sometimes the extra body heat from loved ones can affect my sleep quality.</p>

    <p>Sleep interruptions: My sleep gets disrupted when family members go to bed late, wake up in the middle of the night, or come to my bed.</p>

    <p>Morning sunlight: I try to get morning sunlight, but I feel like food, avoiding screens, and time in bed have a more noticeable impact on my sleep quality.</p>

    <p>Tracking my sleep has been insightful, but getting consistently good sleep has been challenging. After 3-4 days of good sleep, I tend to break my streak due to various reasons. Sometimes I feel bored and end up watching a movie late at night, or catch up on work, leading to screen time before bed. On other occasions, I would not eat right or overeat, and then I'll be bloated through the night. These are all actual ways I sabotage my own efforts for consistently good sleep, but I keep in mind that every day is a gift and a new start.</p>
