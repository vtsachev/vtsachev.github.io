        <h1>Dad Hack: How to Actually Share App Store Purchases with Your Family</h1>
        <div class="date">Mar 2025</div>
        
        <p>Found myself in a classic parent moment yesterday. My older daughter wanted to learn Minecraft on her iPad, so I bought it for $6.99. When my younger one predictably wanted it too, the App Store presented me with the option to buy it again.</p>
        
        <p>Since we were on a Family Sharing plan, I suspected we shouldn't have to buy it twice - that's the whole point of Apple's family features, right? Some digging on Reddit helped me find the solution:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Open the App Store on your iOS device</li>
            <li>Tap your account icon in the upper right corner</li>
            <li>Select "Apps"</li>
            <li>Choose the family member account where you originally bought the app</li>
            <li>Find the app and tap the cloud icon to download (no second payment needed!)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Seems obvious in hindsight, but Apple doesn't make this clear at all. This works for any app eligible for Family Sharing, not just Minecraft.</p>
