    <h1>My observations and reflection on sleep</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>I've been using Whoop to track my sleep, and it's taught me a lot. On average, I need about 7.5 hours of sleep, but to get that, I actually need to be in bed for 8.5 hours because my sleep efficiency is only 85-90%. The quality of my sleep, exercise, and sickness also play a role in how rested I feel, even if I hit my 7.5-hour goal.</p>

    <h2>Factors Affecting Sleep Quality</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Time in Bed</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I used to think 7 hours in bed was enough, but that only gives me about 6.5 hours of actual sleep. I've realized I need more time in bed to get the sleep I need, especially when I'm active and working out daily.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Consistency</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Going to bed at the same time each night helps me fall asleep faster by creating a routine.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Food and Drinks</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Overeating at dinner (like when I ate my burger, fries, and Julie's burger) leads to night sweats and poor sleep.</li>
                <li>Eating dinner right before bed also messes with my sleep.</li>
                <li>Skipping proper meals and snacking excessively affects my sleep quality.</li>
                <li>Afternoon snacking can cause bloating at night, disrupting my sleep.</li>
                <li>Drinking kombucha (which has caffeine) in the evening is a no-go for good sleep.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Caffeine Timing</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The amount and timing of my caffeine intake impact my sleep. I try to cut off caffeine between 1:00-1:30 pm.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Screen Time</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Using my phone, computer, or watching movies before bed makes it harder to fall asleep and sleep well. Avoiding screens close to bedtime is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Room Temperature and Bedding</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The temperature in my bedroom and my bedding play a significant role in my sleep quality. Additionally, while I enjoy the warmth and comfort of being close to my loved ones, sometimes the extra body heat can make me feel a bit too warm during the night, affecting my sleep.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sleep Interruptions</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>My sleep gets disrupted when Eli goes to bed late, my kids wake up in the middle of the night, or Julie comes to my bed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Morning Sunlight</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I try to get morning sunlight, but I feel like food, avoiding screens, and time in bed have a more noticeable impact on my sleep quality.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Tracking my sleep has been eye-opening. While sometimes I can feel okay on less sleep, it catches up to me after a day or two. By paying attention to these factors and making changes, I'm working on improving my sleep quality and overall well-being.</p>
