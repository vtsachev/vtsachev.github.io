        <h1>Ventsi Tsachev</h1>
        <p class="intro">I help early-stage startups build and scale their sales operations. Currently at Trunk.io, where we're working on developer productivity tools.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>My path has been a bit unconventional. I grew up in Bulgaria during its transition from communism to democracy, studied computer science, and started my career as a software engineer at SAP. In 2006, I moved to Silicon Valley, later earned an MBA from Berkeley Haas, and found my way into tech sales.</p>
            
            <p>Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of working with some remarkable teams:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At Google Cloud, joined as the first sales hire for a new AI-powered product division. Our team grew it to 3,000+ customers and $20M ARR â€“ a journey that taught me a lot about scaling processes while maintaining quality.</li>
                <li>Led sales at Triplebyte (later acquired by Karat), where we built the go-to-market strategy from scratch and evolved through multiple business models as the market changed.</li>
                <li>Now at Trunk.io, I'm back in early-stage territory, working on finding product-market fit and building our initial sales motion.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>I enjoy conversations about sales strategy, startup scaling, or the challenges of building early-stage teams. Feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:ventsi@tsachev.us">email</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ventsi/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
